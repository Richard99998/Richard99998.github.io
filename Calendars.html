<h3>My Public Calendar</h3>

<p>
This is my public calendar, which shows my general routine for studying, research, and personal projects. The events are displayed as "busy" to protect privacy. If you want to discuss with me about your 
course-related materials, please refer to this for your meeting:)
</p>
<p>
Please note that all times are automatically adjusted to your local time zone.
