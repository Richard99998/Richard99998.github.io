  <p>
    I'm an student at <a href="https://math.sustech.edu.cn/?lang=en" target="_blank"> Southern University of Science and Technology</a> (SUSTech) in Shenzhen, 
  China. And I'm a member of Fields Honor class which is an elite program for mathematic undergraduates.
  </p>
  <p>
    My research interest is in optimization,numerical methods and other related fields. 
    
    Before I get involved in this area, I'm studying finite group theory, it's quite hard but intersting. And I had a good time during that period.
    But then in the end of my sophomore year, I find that applied mathematics is more attractive for me. Besides enjoying the happiness brought by proving step by step, I can see how it
    affects the real world as well. And that's the reason why I here.
